Problem Statement:

Can a Facebook Fan Base Give a Brand The Advertising Reach It Needs?

Introduction:
Facebook is the prime social media platform for most businesses to build target audiences and generate revenue.
Facebook ads are the best. They allow you to handpick your ad audience’s age, gender, location, job, and nearly any other demographic you can think of.
But the problem with Facebook ads is there’s no guideline to what’s “normal.” No one ever tells you how much you should be paying for a like or a click or what’s the average Cost Per Click for Facebook ads, because it’s different for every business and industry.
For someone just starting out, it can be confusing. 
Hence, Facebook Ad analysis can give you an inside look at Facebook ad performance.
Analysing the elements of each ad can help us understand what worked and what didn’t so we can improve our own Facebook ad performance–getting exponentially more clicks as a result.

The goals of the analysis can be:

•	Identify what the factors have the direct impact on the ad campaign and management team should focus on.

•	Compare how the various ad campaigns are performing with respect to different companies.

•	Quantify how conversion rate varies with age, gender or interest.

•	Identify segments with high and low cost per acquisition and how segment the audience based on click through rates conversion rates.

•	Predict conversion rates for each possible age/gender/interest segment.

The dataset describes the columns in the data as follows:

1.) ad_id: unique ID for each ad.

2.) xyz_campaign_id: an ID associated with each ad campaign of XYZ company.

3.) fb_campaign_id: an ID associated with how Facebook tracks each campaign.

4.) age: age of the person to whom the ad is shown.

5.) gender: gender of the person to whom the add is shown

6.) interest: a code specifying the category to which the person’s interest belongs (interests are as mentioned in the person’s Facebook public profile).

7.) Impressions: the number of times the ad was shown.

8.) Clicks: number of clicks on for that ad.

9.) Spent: Amount paid by company xyz to Facebook, to show that ad.

10.) Total conversion: Total number of people who enquired about the product after seeing the ad.

11.) Approved conversion: Total number of people who bought the product after seeing the ad.
